# API Integration Improvements

## Enhanced Property Listings API Integration

This document outlines the improvements made to the property listings API integration to ensure better reliability and debugging capabilities.

### Key Improvements

1. **Real Data Prioritization**
   - Added protection against sample data fallback
   - Added configuration to force real data usage
   - Implemented preference for cached real properties

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added detailed error logging
   - Improved retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Added multiple fallback endpoints
   - Added cache recovery for API failures

3. **Visual Debugging Tools**
   - Added API call status widget
   - Added sample data warning banner
   - Implemented a debug button for API inspection
   - Added extensive console logging

4. **Cache Management**
   - Added separate cache for real properties
   - Added cache timestamp tracking
   - Implemented cache recovery mechanism
   - Added cache clearing tools

5. **Configuration Enhancements**
   - Added multiple API integration options
   - Added debug mode controls
   - Added retry configuration
   - Added sample data prevention flags

### Debug Button

A debug button has been added to help diagnose API issues:

1. The debug button appears in the bottom right corner
2. Clicking it shows a panel with:
   - Last API response details
   - Cached real properties status
   - Current application state
   - Tools to force refresh properties
   - Cache management options

### Visual API Status Indicators

Visual indicators have been added to show the status of API calls:

1. A debug widget appears during API calls
2. Progress indicators show API request stages
3. Clear warnings when using sample data
4. Error details with recovery options

### Configuration Options

New configuration options have been added to control API behavior:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  apiEndpoint: 'https://eo6b0y2wbmrsq7l.m.pipedream.net',
  fallbackEndpoint: 'https://eo6b0y2wbmrsq7l.m.pipedream.net',
  useSampleAsFallback: false, // Set to false to always attempt real data loading
  forceSampleData: false, // NEVER use sample data
  preventSampleFallback: true, // Always prevent sample data fallback
  alwaysShowRealDebug: true, // Show debug info about real properties
  preferCachedReal: true, // Prefer cached real properties over sample properties
  // Other existing options...
};
```
