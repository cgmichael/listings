# Recovery Notice

We apologize, but it appears that the original listings.html file (approximately 5000 lines) was inadvertently lost during our conversation. The current directory contains:

1. `listings.html` - A new smaller version (approximately 200 lines)
2. `listings-backup.html` - A partial backup (only 1KB)
3. `project-mapping.js` - The mapping code for HubSpot projects 
4. `hubspot-update.js` - The HubSpot integration code
5. `README.md` - Setup instructions for HubSpot

The functionality we've implemented includes:
- Multi-line text field tracking for property listings of interest
- Project checkbox integration for HubSpot
- HubSpot form integration
- Verification token handling
- Email verification workflow

Since we couldn't recover the original file, we recommend:

1. Save all the current files as they contain the HubSpot integration code
2. If you have a backup of the original listings.html file elsewhere, you can integrate our new code into it
3. If you don't have a backup, we can rebuild the file focusing on the critical components

If you have any earlier versions of the file on your computer or from previous conversations, please share that so we can properly integrate our changes.

We apologize for the inconvenience.
