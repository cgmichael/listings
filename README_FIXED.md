# Fixed HubSpot Integration for Property Listings

## Issue Fixed
The implementation has been fixed to ensure both:
1. Properties load correctly
2. HubSpot integration works properly

## Files

### Main Files
- `fixed_version_with_hubspot.html` - Use this file for the complete working implementation
- `fixed_hubspot_integration.js` - The separated HubSpot integration code (loaded by the main HTML file)

### Original Files (For Reference)
- `working_original.html` - The original working version without HubSpot
- `Listing Directory Index.html` - The previous version that had issues

## Implementation Details

This implementation:
1. Keeps the HubSpot tracking separate from the main application code
2. Preserves full property loading functionality
3. Properly tracks:
   - Favorited properties
   - Unfavorited properties
   - Property comparisons
   - Property inquiries
4. Updates HubSpot using:
   - API endpoint (if available)
   - HubSpot Forms API (main fallback)
   - iFrame method (final fallback)

## How to Use

1. Simply open `fixed_version_with_hubspot.html` in your browser to use the fixed version
2. All property favorites, comparisons, and inquiries will be tracked in HubSpot
3. No authentication overlay is included, ensuring properties always load
