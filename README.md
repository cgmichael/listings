# Listing Directory HubSpot Integration - Enhanced API Version

This guide explains how to set up HubSpot to capture leads from the property listings directory.

## API Integration Improvements

The enhanced version includes several improvements to API integration:

- More robust error handling for API calls
- Enhanced debugging tools to diagnose API issues
- Cache management for real property data
- Visual indicators for API call status
- Protection against sample data fallback
- Debug panel for API response inspection

## HubSpot Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Custom Properties

Create the following custom properties in HubSpot:

| Property Name | Field Type | Description |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| `cg_verification_token` | Single-line text | Stores verification token for email verification |
| `cg_verification_link` | Single-line text | Full verification link sent in emails |
| `cg_needs_verification` | Yes/No | Indicates if contact needs verification |
| `cg_verified` | Yes/No | Whether contact has been verified |
| `cg_verification_date` | Date | When verification occurred |
| `cg_listings_of_interest` | Multi-line text | Stores property listings the user has shown interest in (one per line) |
| `notes_last_updated` | Date | Tracks the last activity date |

### 2. Create Multi-Checkbox Field

Create a multi-checkbox field called `all_projects_of_interest` with the following options:

1. Ashton Gardens
2. Bloomfield
3. Botanica
4. Garfield Grange
5. One FairWay
6. Paddington Estate
7. Park Avenue 
8. Park Avenue II
9. River Oaks
10. Rivi√®re

17. 627 Windsor Rd
18. 567 Windsor Rd
19. 505-535 Fifteenth Ave
20. 155 Boyd St
21. General Enquiry
22. cg_castle_luxe

### 3. Create Verification Email

1. Create an email template in HubSpot Marketing
2. Add a button with the verification link: `{{% cg_verification_link %}}`
3. Add your email template ID to the code configuration

### 4. Create Verification Workflow

1. Create a workflow triggered when `cg_needs_verification = Yes`
2. Action: Send email using your template
3. Add email reminder after 15 minutes if still unverified

## Code Implementation Notes

The implementation uses:

- HubSpot Forms API for submitting lead data
- HubSpot tracking API for event tracking
- Custom properties to track verification status
- Multi-checkbox field for project tracking
- Multi-line text field for detailed listings interest

For multiple listings of interest, each new inquiry adds the property to both:
1. `all_projects_of_interest` checkbox field
2. `cg_listings_of_interest` text field (as a new line)

This allows you to see both a summary of which projects interest the lead and specific property details.
