# HubSpot Integration for Property Listings

## Complete Solution File

The complete HubSpot integration is now consolidated into a single file:

- `fixed_complete.html` - This is the only file you need to use

## Implementation Details

This all-in-one file includes:

1. The original working property listings functionality
2. HubSpot tracking scripts in the head:
   ```html
   <script type="text/javascript" id="hs-script-loader" async defer src="//js.hs-scripts.com/24160521.js"></script>
   <script charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript" src="//js.hsforms.net/forms/embed/v2.js"></script>
   ```
3. Complete HubSpot integration script at the end of the body:
   - Property interest tracking
   - Project mapping
   - Form submission handling
   - User data persistence
   - Extended CastleApp functionality

## Features

This implementation:
1. Preserves full property loading functionality
2. Properly tracks in HubSpot:
   - Favorited properties
   - Unfavorited properties (removes from tracking)
   - Property comparisons
   - Property inquiries
3. Updates HubSpot using multiple fallback methods:
   - API endpoint (if available)
   - HubSpot Forms API (primary fallback)
   - iFrame method (final fallback)
4. Includes project mapping for all 22 required projects

## HubSpot Configuration

The HubSpot configuration is set with:
- Portal ID: 24160521
- Form ID: a00f1f67-1490-44a7-a571-142da5377383
- Form URL: https://share.hsforms.com/1oA8fZxSQRKelcRQtpTdzgwedudl

## Usage
1. Simply use the `fixed_complete.html` file
2. No additional files are needed - everything is self-contained
3. All property favorites, comparisons, and inquiries will be tracked in HubSpot
4. Properties load correctly with no authentication overlay

## Next Steps

After implementing this solution, you should:

1. Set up the custom HubSpot properties as outlined in the README.md
2. Create the verification email template in HubSpot
3. Set up the verification workflow in HubSpot
4. Implement server-side endpoints if needed for API access
